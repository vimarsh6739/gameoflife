# gameoflife
CS6023(GPU Programming) Project to simulate and render Conway's Game of Life in Cuda C++ and OpenGL

To compile the project with display, do
`make run`

To begin the display after that, do
`./bin`

The display supports resizing, and has the option to switch between CPU and GPU computation. The rendering is done using a 2D texture with the help of the GLUT Library. FPS is also displayed on the screen during the running of the program.
